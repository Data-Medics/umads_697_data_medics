# Recommended Actions

## Actionable Insights

We also felt it would be extremely valuable to aggregate and simplify the actions being recommended on Twitter.  This could range from sites where donations were being collected to locations where resources and food could be picked up by those affected.  To accomplish this we collected Tweets concerning donations and aid around natural disasters - current Tweets relevant to natural disasters via our disaster specific search term topics and classified as a relevant Tweet via our classification model - and parsed the Tweet for the pieces of information we were interested in.  We had mixed results; due to the varied structure of the Tweets it was often hard for NLP tools to correctly identify the subject and objects in a Tweet, making it difficult to tag the parts of speech for later use.  Additionally, with relatively small low character count caps on Tweets, reducing the information is not as useful.  However, we did find it very valuable that we were able to aggregate Tweets, re-Tweets, and links across a large corpus.  While there might be worry that we are simply amplifying already popular Tweets,  anecdotally we did find that the popular Tweets (measured via retweet count) often contained the best information and that there was value in making these popular Tweets easy to find.
